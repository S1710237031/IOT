#Lab Reports 



##Lab 4
We had some problems with the relay switch. It was not reading the temperature and turning off or on correctly. 
Node-red was not that difficult to use once you get used to it. There are many helpful tutorials and rather good documentation. But we had another issue with sending the LED color, because we had to convert the string it sends to RGB values and it took us a while to figure that out.

##Lab 5
Unfortunately Flogo took very long to set up. I had to install Flogo and Go, among some other tools. There arenâ€™t many tutorials on the internet on how to use Flogo, so it was difficult getting started. For me it was much more confusing than Node-red. But with a little help I managed to finish the task.
