##Lab 5
Unfortunately Flogo took very long to set up. I had to install Flogo and Go, among some other tools. There arenâ€™t many tutorials on the internet on how to use Flogo, so it was difficult getting started. For me it was much more confusing than Node-red. But with a little help I managed to finish the task.
