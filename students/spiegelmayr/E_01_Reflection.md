#Lab 1
We had some problems with setting up the Arduino, because the micro USB cable did not work. When choosing a port in the Arduino IDE the correct port was not recognized. When we received a different cable we could finish the task. The blinking example was very similar to a lab example we did in hardware programming, so after getting acquainted with the IDE it was not that difficult to finish. 
With the second task we had the issue that we forgot to connect the second Arduino to the Raspberry Pi network, so it did not work. There was not enough time for us to finish this exercise.
