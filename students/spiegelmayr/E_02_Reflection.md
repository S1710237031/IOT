#Lab 2
We were still not finished with the remote blinking task, so my colleague continued working on that one while I moved on to the new exercise. Once again connecting to the Arduino was an issue since my USB-C to USB adapter did not work. I set up the event and had it send a Telegram message to me every time a certain URL that triggers the event was opened. I had to test my code later at home on a different computer with a USB port, so I did not need to use the adapter.
