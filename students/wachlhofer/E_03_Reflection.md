The third lecture was a real downer at the beginning we where trying to get our Raspberry Pi to connect to the FH network but none of the four network sockets where connected or just not working. Ulrich then pulled us out of our misery by just connecting the network cable from the professorâ€™s desk to our raspberry. It was frustrating, but we could finally start working on some of the new exercises.
